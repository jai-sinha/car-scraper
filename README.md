## Overview:

This project is intended as a tool to make searching for a specific cool car easier! It should not be used for (or take away) the timeless joy of randomly browsing cool cars. But basically with (sort of) one click, it pulls and outputs results from a number of commonly-used websites, saving the user from the repetitive task of cross-checking the same make/model/year/etc over and over while searching for the right one to buy.

## API Instructions:
Get your free Google API Key [here](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview), and add it to `keys/keys.json` under `"google"`.
